# UnitySWars
Importer / Exporter of Syndicate Wars files for Unity Game Engine

Drop GAME folder of SWars install CD into Assets folder to use.


**Assets/Scenes/SampleScene**: Scene for testing the different loaders. Navigate to the _SwarsLoader_ object and press the _Initialise_ button to load the current setup. 

_SwarsLoader/Maps_ can be used to control which map(s) to load. Ticking _Load Range_ enables loading multiple maps simultaneously - be careful, this can end up being _a lot_ of Unity objects. 

For now, do **NOT** save the scene, it'll cause you problems later on. Switch to a different scene and back again to visualise a different map.
